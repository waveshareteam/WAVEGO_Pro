accesspopup
	ver 0.0-9 16 Apr 2025
		If wifi has been disabled on the system, when AccessPopup is run it would re-activate wifi. Some users may be managing their power usage by switching wifi off for periods of time.
		So I have implemented a re_enable_wifi='y' option at the top of the script. This can be set to 'y' or 'n' as required. This can also be changed via the installer script.
		If re_enable_wifi= is set to 'n', accesspopup will still do checks every 2 minutes but will only assess the wifi connection status when Wifi has been enabled by other means on the system.
	ver 0.8-8 06 Oct 2024
		The AccessPoint would disconnect from connected devices for some users. This is caused by wifi power saving mode. The power saving has been switched off for the AccessPopup profile. 
	ver 0.8-7 10 Sep 2024
		If the AP profile is invalid for for some reason it will be deleted and recreated. On creation it was activated before the IP address is changed.
		The device is brought down until the ip has been changed and then activated. 
	ver 0.8-6 12 Jul 2024
		Some users reporting that while using a phone, they are unable to connect to the AP running on a RaspberryPi Zero W with PiOS Bookworm 32bit. Removing the AccessPopup profiles security group and strict encryption references from the 
		config file solves the issue. These are automatically set by nmcli on creation of the profile in addition to how the Network Manager GUI creates the profile.
		This issue only affected the PizeroW. The PiZero2 and Pi3/3B+ did not have an issue.
	ver 0.8-5 27 Mar 2024
		Only wireless profiles with a priority higher than -900 will be considered during a switch from the access point.
			Users can exclude wireless profiles from being connected to, with the priority. These profiles would need to be manually selected to be use.
		fixed issue where non wireless devices such as tun are wrongly being selected as a valid Network Manager profile. 
	ver 0.8-4 3 Feb 2024
		changes systemd check from string results to exit codes
	ver 0.8-3 23 Jan 2024

	ver 0.8-2 20 Jan 2024
		Fixed SSID's with spaces where handled until the profile activation, then caused profile to be unknown
		cleaned up output text and messages
		added more error handeling 
	ver 0.8-1 12 Jan 2024
		typo in active_wifi function caused 'if' statement to always be true. So always checked rather when just when required
	ver 0.8 11 Dec 2023
		Initial Release
